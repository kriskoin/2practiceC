## Longest subarray
Longest subarray in which all elements are greater than K
Given an array of N integers and a number K, the task is to find the length of the longest subarray in which all the elements are greater than K. 
Examples: 
 

Input: a[] = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 10, 11}, K = 5 
Output: 2 
There are two possible longest subarrays of length 2. 
They are {6, 7} and {10, 11}.
Input: a[] = {8, 25, 10, 19, 19, 18, 20, 11, 18}, K = 13 
Output: 4 
The longest subarray is {19, 19, 18, 20}.
